# My solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 puzzles

I travel back in time to 2024 to solve the puzzles from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) event.

Just my attempts at solving the puzzles, not necessarily the best solutions.

check out the puzzles at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

I will mainly be using python, but I might try some other languages as well.

## **Note**

- I will try to not post my puzzle input, so you will have to get your own.

- python solutions were written in python 3.12.3, and may not work on older versions.

- Kotlin solutions were written in Kotlin 2.1.0
